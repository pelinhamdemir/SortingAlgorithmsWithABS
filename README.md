This project analyzed the performance of four commonly used sorting algorithms: Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort and analyzes their affects on BasicAbs method. The project also includes a NoSort algorithm, which simply returns the input array without sorting it. The project measured the time taken by each algorithm to sort arrays of different sizes and with different initial ordering (random, ascending, and descending).

Example:

Enter Sorting options:
Selection // Options can be Selection, insertion, Merge, quick and noSort.
//Also, SeLeCtion is the valid option.
Enter array:
113 23 1 109 4 102 7 105 100 107 // Always has ten integer elements.
ABS:2, Min=100, Max=102 //print abs difference, minimum of pair, maximum of pair.
