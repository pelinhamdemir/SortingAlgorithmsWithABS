This project analyzed the performance of four commonly used sorting algorithms: Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort and analyzes their affects on BasicAbs method. The project also includes a NoSort algorithm, which simply returns the input array without sorting it. The project measured the time taken by each algorithm to sort arrays of different sizes and with different initial ordering (random, ascending, and descending).
